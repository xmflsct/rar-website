Make your own unique indigo dyed tote bag by using Shibori technique(s) of your choice!

We are so excited that we will host our first workshop in the shop with Inge Timan :)

#### Shibori Indigo Dye Workshop
The workshop will be an introduction to Shibori, which is the Japanese name for a collection of manual resist dye techniques from Japan.
In this workshop you're going to make your own unique indigo dyed tote bag by using Shibori technique(s) of your choice. We are going to use natural fabrics such as cotton and linen and natural Indigo dye.
You'll also get a workshop hand-out with some extra info and pictures of examples of the techniques so you can start your own experimenting at home.
Of course, you will also enjoy our cakes and tea ^_^ Let's have great fun together.
