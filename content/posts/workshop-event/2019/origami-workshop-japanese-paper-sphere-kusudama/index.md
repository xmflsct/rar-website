Let's discover a traditional Japanese paper sphere, called, "Kusudama!"

It is formed by modular Origami construction techniques or assembled with modular Origami pieces together.
In the coming workshop you will learn the techniques: how to fold a modular piece and to make a simple, but cute and challenging enough geometric shape. Each of you make your own Kusudama:)

Your hand-crafted Kusudama balls from the workshop will be your own cute gifts or home decorations:)
