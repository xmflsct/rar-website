      <h2>2. Easter Specials / Cake Rolls / Other Cakes and Sweets</h2>
      <p>
        Below are the cakes that can be ordered in advance online, and pick-up
        in our shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        One entire cake roll is about 22cm long. One cake roll slice is about
        3cm long. We can slice your entire roll order into slices, usually in 7
        pieces. If needed, please leave a note when you checkout.
      </p>
      <p>
        We highly recommend to order in advance for centainty. It is also easier
        for us to prepare for you. We will pack your order in advance so the
        pick-up process will be faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also just drop by during our opening hours to buy cakes and
        drinks <strong>for take away</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please mind social distancing. We only allow <strong>1 guest</strong>{" "}
        drop in each time.
        <br />
        Thank you for your understanding!
