Our little forest is ready to welcome you and your friends. We want to offer a space with a sense of cuteness, to relax  people in a busy city life. Here you can experience our cross-cultural cakes with a natural taste. You can also check out the crafts collection in our shop from worldwide brands and designers. What’s more, how about just sitting down and have a nice cup of tea or coffee, spending some peaceful ‘forest time’, or join our creative workshops later on?</p>\n<p>Come and experience Round&#x26;Round on the 16th, for some free bites, limited Hightea vouchers and taste our special homemade cakes and drinks.</p>\n<h4>A Dream Comes True</h4>\n<p>We are Bing &#x26; Chao, the hosts of Round&#x26;Round. We graduated from the TU Delft, Interaction Design and Computer Science. Different backgrounds, same passion on bringing a cross-cultural cake concept to Holland. 9 Months ago, we started our journey on opening our dream store.  </p>\n<p>Inspired by Chinese and Japanese recipes and baking styles, we made our cakes “Guilt-free’: low-fat, low sugar and only use seasonal ingredients and natural colouring. We put our own thoughts and design-minds into our products: we design our cakes. In our store we want to re-interpret ‘cuteness’ for adults and we hope you will like it and get inspired.</p>\n<p>After several creative open markets, events, tough research period and happy learning time, we finally have our store on Hoogstraat Rotterdam. We love this place and we want to bring warmth and new ideas to this community and Rotterdam.</p>\n<p>So here we are! We look forward to seeing you in Round&#x26;Round on the 16th!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Grand Opening of Round&Round!","date":"2016-01-16","time":"14:00 - 17:00","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.7027027027027026,"src":"/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/bc3a8/main.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/d278e/main.jpg 200w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/8539d/main.jpg 400w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/bc3a8/main.jpg 800w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/81ef8/main.jpg 1200w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/989b1/main.jpg 1600w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/c82f6/main.jpg 2400w","srcWebp":"/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/c6096/main.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/1932c/main.webp 200w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/f4957/main.webp 400w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/c6096/main.webp 800w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/b6424/main.webp 1200w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/7a72d/main.webp 1600w,\n/static/7538242f390ec5f51c53c1bd1e12bdf1/c5845/main.webp 2400w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}},"link":"https://business.facebook.com/events/989150481131560/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/workshop-event/2016/grand-opening-of-round-round/"}}}
